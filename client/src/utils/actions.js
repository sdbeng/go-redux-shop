/* 
With these three actions, we're defining how three parts of our state will be maintained and updated:

UPDATE_PRODUCTS is used by the ProductList component. Right now, we're getting all of our product data from the server, and Apollo caches the results. This is great for performance, but it also means we have to go through Apollo every time we want to update that list. The end goal here is to store the data retrieved for products by Apollo in this global state. This way, we can add offline capabilities later and persist our product data!

UPDATE_CATEGORIES works a lot like UPDATE_PRODUCTS in that we want to take the list of categories retrieved from the server by Apollo and store it in this global state. Again, this will allow us to easily add offline capabilities at a future point in this project.

UPDATE_CURRENT_CATEGORY is sort of the connecting piece of data for the previous two actions we created, in that we want to be able to select a category from the state created by the UPDATE_CATEGORIES action and display products for that category from the list we create from the UPDATE_PRODUCTS action.
